"""Memori baseline — hosted cognitive memory service.

Memori (memori 1.x) is a commercial hosted memory service. Like Mem0
and Letta, it solves retrieval — no belief revision, no propagation,
no contradiction detector.

REQUIRES: `MEMORI_API_KEY` env var (their hosted backend). Memori
also needs a Postgres-compatible connection callable for local state;
without it, the SDK raises `MissingPsycopgError`. This adapter falls
back to fail-loud on either missing prerequisite.
