"""Scoring functions for BusinessMemBench answers.

Each category uses a different scorer:

  binary_in_band       — confidence falls in [min, max]?
  f1_on_pair_recall    — set F1 on (pair, pair) recall
  ordered_chain_recall_f1 — F1 on ordered chain match
  cross_stream_overlap — does the answer flag the disagreement source?
  historical_exact     — string match against gold answer
  provenance_chain     — every claim has a verifiable evidence_kref?
  forgetfulness        — was the deprecated belief NOT returned?

Scorers return a float in [0.0, 1.0]; harness aggregates per category.

Spec: 08 - BusinessMemBench Design.md § 3 (each category has scoring rules)
