"""Atlas Coffee Roasting Co. — synthetic business corpus + question
generator for BusinessMemBench.

Deterministic from a single seed so benchmark runs are reproducible.
Covers a 90-day operational window (2026-01-01 → 2026-03-31) with
realistic events: pricing changes, hires, decisions, contradictions,
deprecations.

Public surface:
  generate_corpus(out_dir, seed=42)         — writes corpus/ + ground_truth.json
  generate_questions(out_dir, seed=42)      — writes gold/<category>.jsonl
